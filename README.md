# Classification on starbucks satisfactory surveys
    * introduction
        Machine learning: Machine learning is a process of feeding a machine enough data to train and predict a possible outcome using the algorithms. the more the processed or useful data is fed to the machine the more efficient the machine will become. When the data is complicated it learns the data and builds the prediction model. It is state that more the data, better the model, higher will be the accuracy. There are many ways for machine learning i.e., supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

        Supervised Learning: In supervised learning machine learning model learns through the feature and labels of the object. Supervised learning uses labelled data to train the model here, the machine knew the features of the object and labels associated with those features or we can say that the supervised learning uses the set of data where the labels or the desired outcomes are already known. It is allowed to prediction about the unseen or future data

        Unsupervised Learning: These are called unsupervised learning because unlike supervised learning above there is no correct answers and there is no teacher.Algorithms are left to their own devises to discover and present the interesting structure in the data. The unsupervised learning algorithms learn few features from the data. When new data is introduced, it uses the previously learned features to recognize the class of the data. It is mainly used for clustering and feature reduction.

    * implementations
        logic:The implementation logic of this analysis can be summarized as a structured and systematic approach to extracting insights from a dataset. It commences with the critical step of data loading, where the Pandas library in Python is employed to read a CSV file, transforming it into a Pandas Data Frame for further manipulation. This step is crucial in understanding the dataset's structure and ensuring data integrity. Following data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to gain insights into the data's characteristics and relationships. Additionally, data preprocessing techniques, such as label encoding, are applied as necessary to prepare the dataset for modelling. Subsequently, predictive models, including Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression, are constructed using Scikit-Learn. The models are evaluated using key metrics like R-squared and RMSE. Finally, data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn are utilized to create informative plots, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and model results. This structured approach, encompassing data loading, EDA, preprocessing, modelling, evaluation, and visualization, forms the foundation for deriving meaningful insights from the dataset in this analysis.

        Data Preprocessing: Data preprocessing is a pivotal phase in any data analysis project, and it plays a critical role in ensuring that the data is ready for analysis and modelling. In this analysis, data preprocessing encompasses two main aspects: handling missing values and label encoding of categorical data.

        Handling Missing Values: One of the initial steps in data preprocessing is to check for missing values within the dataset. Missing data can be problematic as it can lead to biased analyses and incorrect conclusions. In this analysis, a systematic check for missing values is performed using the Pandas library. The data. isnull(). any() method is used to identify columns where missing values might be present. Fortunately, in this particular dataset, the results show that none of the columns contain missing values.

        Label Encoding of Categorical Data: Another essential aspect of data preprocessing in this analysis is the conversion of categorical data into a numerical format, a process known as label encoding. Categorical data represents non-numeric information, such as product names or labels, which cannot be directly used as inputs for machine learning models. Label encoding is a technique used to transform categorical data into a numerical format, enabling models to work effectively with such data.

        Model Building: Model building is a pivotal phase in data analysis, where mathematical and statistical models are constructed to understand and predict relationships within the dataset. In this analysis, two regression models are built: Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression. Each model serves a distinct purpose in modeling the relationship between price and quantity ordered, with Linear Regression capturing linear relationships and Polynomial Regression introducing non- linearity.

    I. Logistic Regression: 
        It is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning used for binary classification problems. It is particularly valuable when you need to predict a binary outcome (yes/no, true/false, 0/1) based on one or more predictor variables.

        1. Model and Hypothesis: Logistic Regression models the relationship between the dependent binary variable and one or more independent predictor variables. The goal is to estimate the probability that a given input belongs to a specific class (e.g., class 1). The logistic function (sigmoid function) is used as the hypothesis function. It maps any real-valued number to a value between 0 and 1, making it suitable for binary classification.

        2. Training: Logistic Regression uses a process called Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) or optimization techniques like gradient descent. The goal is to find the parameters that maximize the likelihood of the observed data given the model.

        3. Decision Boundary: Logistic Regression creates a decision boundary that separates the two classes. This boundary can be linear or nonlinear, depending on the relationship between the predictor variables and the log-odds of the dependent variable.

        4. Prediction: Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions. Given new input data, the model calculates the probability of the input belonging to class 1 using the logistic function. You can set a threshold (e.g., 0.5) to classify the input into one of the two classes based on this probability

        5. Evaluation: Logistic Regression models are evaluated using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curves, and AUC. These metrics help assess the model's performance and its ability to discriminate between the two classes.
        Advantages of Logistic Regression:
            • Simplicity: It is a straightforward and interpretable algorithm.
            • Efficiency: It can handle large datasets efficiently.
            • Works well with linearly separable data.
            • Provides probability estimates.
    
    II. A Decision Tree Classifier:
        It is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is a tree-like model that makes predictions by recursively splitting the dataset into subsets based on the most significant attributes. Here is an overview of how Decision Tree Classification works.

        1. Splitting Criteria: Decision Trees begin by selecting the best attribute to split the dataset into subsets. The choice of attribute and the splitting criteria are crucial for building an effective tree. Common splitting criteria for classification include Gini impurity and Information Gain (Entropy). Gini Impurity: Measures the probability of a randomly chosen element being incorrectly classified. A lower Gini impurity indicates better purity (homogeneity). Information Gain (Entropy): Measures the reduction in uncertainty (impurity) achieved by splitting the dataset based on a particular attribute. Higher information gain implies a better split.

        2. Recursive Splitting: Once the initial attribute and splitting criterion are chosen, the dataset is divided into subsets, and the process is repeated for each subset. This recursive splitting continues until one of the stopping conditions is met.
        • The tree reaches a predefined depth limit.
        • All instances in a subset belong to the same class (pure node).
        • The number of instances in a subset falls below a specified threshold.
        • Other predefined stopping criteria are met.

        3. Decision Making: At each node of the tree, a decision is made based on the majority class in the subset. For classification, this means that the class with the most occurrences in the subset is assigned to that node. For regression, the average of the target values in the subset is used. 
        
        4. Pruning (Optional): Decision Trees can be prone to overfitting, where the tree captures noise or outliers in the training data. Pruning is the process of removing branches that do not provide significant predictive power. It helps prevent overfitting and results in a simpler, more interpretable tree.
        Advantages of Decision Tree Classifier:
        • Easy to understand and interpret, making it a valuable tool for explaining decisions.
        • Handles both categorical and numerical data.
        • No need for extensive data preprocessing (e.g., feature scaling).
        • Can handle non-linear relationships in data.

    III. Random Forest: 
        It is an ensemble machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is a powerful and versatile algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and reduce overfitting. Here is how the Random Forest algorithm works.

        1. Ensemble of Decision Trees:
        Random Forest is an ensemble method that consists of a collection of decision trees. Each decision tree in the ensemble is trained independently on a randomly sampled subset of the training data (bootstrapped sample), and a random subset of the features is considered for each split. This randomness in data sampling and feature selection helps introduce diversity among the individual trees.

        2. Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating): Random Forest employs a technique called bagging, which stands for "Bootstrap Aggregating." Bagging involves repeatedly selecting random samples (with replacement) from the original training dataset to create multiple subsets. Each decision tree is then trained on one of these subsets, making each tree slightly different from the others. 
        
        3. Feature Randomness: In addition to using bootstrapped samples, Random Forest introduces feature randomness by considering only a random subset of features at each node when deciding how to split the data. These further increases diversity among the trees. 
        
        4. Voting or Averaging: For classification tasks, Random Forest combines the predictions of individual decision trees by majority voting. Each tree "votes" for a class, and the class with the most votes becomes the predicted class. For regression tasks, the predictions of individual trees are averaged to obtain the final prediction.
        Advantages of Random Forest:
        • High Accuracy: Random Forest typically yields high predictive accuracy due to the ensemble of diverse decision trees.
        • Reduced Overfitting: By aggregating the predictions of multiple
        trees, Random Forest reduces the risk of overfitting compared to a single decision tree.
        • Handles High-Dimensional Data: It can handle datasets with a large number of features without feature selection or dimensionality reduction.
        • Robustness: Random Forest is robust to outliers and noisy data.
