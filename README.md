# Classification on starbucks satisfactory surveys
    * introduction
        Machine learning: Machine learning is a process of feeding a machine enough data to train and predict a possible outcome using the algorithms. the more the processed or useful data is fed to the machine the more efficient the machine will become. When the data is complicated it learns the data and builds the prediction model. It is state that more the data, better the model, higher will be the accuracy. There are many ways for machine learning i.e., supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

        Supervised Learning: In supervised learning machine learning model learns through the feature and labels of the object. Supervised learning uses labelled data to train the model here, the machine knew the features of the object and labels associated with those features or we can say that the supervised learning uses the set of data where the labels or the desired outcomes are already known. It is allowed to prediction about the unseen or future data

        Unsupervised Learning: These are called unsupervised learning because unlike supervised learning above there is no correct answers and there is no teacher.Algorithms are left to their own devises to discover and present the interesting structure in the data. The unsupervised learning algorithms learn few features from the data. When new data is introduced, it uses the previously learned features to recognize the class of the data. It is mainly used for clustering and feature reduction.

    * Objective
        The primary objective of this dataset is to facilitate data driven decision making for Starbucks and researchers interested in understanding customer behaviour and enhancing the Starbucks experience. It can be used for various analytical and predictive purposes to drive marketing strategies, improve service quality, and optimize product offerings.
